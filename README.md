Pytorch models for interpreting neuroimaging data.\
This project exists in orbit around one fundamental question: to what extent can the world model learnt during language model pretraining by transformers map to neural representations. To test this, I will start with a basic non-causal transformer encoder that generates embeddings which are concatenated onto the embeddings of the tokens generated by a frozen pre trained transformer that does the inference. Doing it this way gives a simple baseline to improve upon. It will also be interesting from a mechanistic interpreability standpoint to watch the generated embeddings move through token space as the encoder learns. The following questions will be of interest:

- How well does the model trained on the EEG data taken during the viewing of a set of objects generalise to the EEG data from an unseen set?
- How much do the EEG samples taken before or after the object was being viewed impact the accuracy of the model?
- the GPT will intially be frozen under the assumption that finetuning it will modify its representations of the out-of-distribution validation examples such that their logits are effectively never sampled...is that true?
- Are there more effective architectures?
